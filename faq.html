          </details>
          <details>

          <details>
            <summary>Why doesn’t my oversized curling iron fit?</summary>
            <p>

            </ul>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Troubleshooting</summary>
            <p><strong>The magnetic closure isn’t staying shut.</strong></p>
            <p>Ensure the bag is not overfilled. Excess bulk may prevent the magnet from aligning properly.</p>
            <p><strong>My tool feels tight inside the bag.</strong></p>
            <p>Verify that the tool length does not exceed 15.5 inches and that cords are wrapped neatly.</p>
            <p><strong>The bag has a slight scent when new.</strong></p>
            <p>New neoprene may have a mild manufacturing scent. Air the bag out for 24 hours before use.</p>
