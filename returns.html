          <details>
            <summary>How long do refunds take?</summary>
            <p>We will notify you once we have received and inspected your return and let you know whether your refund is approved. If approved, refunds are credited to your original payment method. Please allow up to one week for processing after approval, and up to 10 business days for the refund to be issued. Banks and credit card providers may take additional time to post funds. If more than 15 business days have passed since approval, please contact us.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What items cannot be returned?</summary>
            <p>We do not accept returns for perishable goods (such as food, flowers, or plants), custom products (such as special orders or personalized items), personal care goods (such as beauty products), hazardous materials, flammable liquids, gases, sale items, or gift cards.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can I exchange instead of return?</summary>
            <p>The fastest way to get what you want is to return the item you have. After your return is accepted, place a separate purchase for the replacement item.</p>
