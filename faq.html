            <summary>Quick Start Guide</summary>
            <ol>
              <li>Unfold the bag fully.</li>
              <li>
                Insert your styling tools (flat iron, curling iron, wand, etc.) into the main compartment.
              </li>
              <li>Use the interior pockets for clips and small accessories.</li>
              <li>
                While styling, lay the bag flat and use the heat-resistant interior mat to safely rest hot
                tools.
              </li>
              <li>After use, you may store tools inside the bag, even before fully cooled.</li>
              <li>Close securely using the zipper and the magnetic closure.</li>
            </ol>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What tools fit inside this bag?</summary>
            <p>
              This bag measures 15.5" x 5" x 5" inches and is designed to fit most:
            </p>
            <ul>

              <li>Curling irons</li>

              <li>Hair straighteners</li>
              <li>Heat brushes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If your tool exceeds 15.5 inches in length, it may not fit properly.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can I place hot tools directly inside the bag?</summary>
            <p>
              The interior features a heat-resistant mat lining, allowing you to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Set down hot tools during styling</li>
              <li>Store tools before they are fully cooled</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For safety, always turn tools off before storing.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What is the bag made from?</summary>
            <p>
              The exterior is made from heavy-duty, double-layered neoprene, which is:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Soft</li>
              <li>Durable</li>
              <li>Wear-resistant</li>
              <li>Heat-resistant</li>
              <li>Travel-friendly</li>
            </ul>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>How many interior pockets are included?</summary>
            <p>The bag includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Two interior pockets</li>
              <li>One zippered pocket</li>
              <li>Two elastic band sections (ideal for clips and small accessories)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This helps keep cords and accessories organized while traveling.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can I use this while traveling?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. The compact 15.5" design fits easily inside carry-on luggage and helps keep tools organized
              and separated from clothing.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Why doesn’t my oversized curling iron fit?</summary>
            <p>
              This bag accommodates tools up to 15.5 inches in length. Extra-long or salon-length tools may
              exceed this capacity.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>How do I clean the bag?</summary>
            <ul>
              <li>Wipe clean with a damp cloth and mild soap.</li>
              <li>Air dry completely before storing tools.</li>
              <li>Do not machine wash.</li>
            </ul>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Troubleshooting</summary>
            <p><strong>The magnetic closure isn’t staying shut.</strong></p>
            <p>Ensure the bag is not overfilled. Excess bulk may prevent the magnet from aligning properly.</p>
            <p><strong>My tool feels tight inside the bag.</strong></p>
            <p>Verify that the tool length does not exceed 15.5 inches and that cords are wrapped neatly.</p>
            <p><strong>The bag has a slight scent when new.</strong></p>
            <p>New neoprene may have a mild manufacturing scent. Air the bag out for 24 hours before use.</p>

              <li>Extend the telescoping handle on your carry-on suitcase.</li>
              <li>Slide the organizer harness over the top handle.</li>
              <li>Adjust the straps until the organizer fits snugly and securely.</li>
              <li>

                  <li>Books or small accessories</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Tighten straps again before moving through the airport.</li>
            </ol>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What is this organizer designed for?</summary>
            <p>
              This luggage organizer slides over your carry-on suitcase handle to provide extra storage space
              for essential travel items such as passports, phones, books, chargers, and small electronics.
            </p>
            <p>
              It allows hands-free travel without needing a purse or backpack for quick-access items.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Will this fit my suitcase?</summary>
            <p>
              The adjustable strap system is designed to fit most popular cabin luggage brands with a standard
              telescoping handle. If your suitcase has a traditional extendable handle, it should fit securely
              once adjusted.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Does it work for kids' luggage as well?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. The adjustable straps allow for a more customized fit on both adult and children's carry-on
              luggage.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What size laptop fits in the organizer?</summary>
            <p>
              The built-in laptop pocket can hold most tablets, iPads, gaming consoles, and laptops up to
              approximately 16 inches (depending on thickness and case).
            </p>
            <p>If your device has a bulky protective case, removing it may improve fit.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can I store multiple tech items?</summary>
            <p>Yes. In addition to the laptop sleeve, the additional pockets can hold:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A mouse</li>
              <li>Charging cables</li>
              <li>Power banks</li>
              <li>Small electronics</li>
              <li>Travel accessories</li>
            </ul>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Is the material durable?</summary>
            <p>
              The organizer is made from lightweight, heavy-duty nylon that is:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Durable</li>
              <li>Wear-resistant</li>
              <li>Designed for travel use</li>
              <li>Protective of stored contents</li>
            </ul>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can I use this on checked luggage?</summary>
            <p>
              This product is optimized for carry-on luggage with a telescoping handle. Stability may vary on
              checked luggage without a rigid top handle.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>How do I clean the organizer?</summary>

          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Why does the organizer shift while walking?</summary>

            <ul>
              <li>Straps are not tightened fully</li>
              <li>The organizer is overloaded</li>
              <li>The handle is not fully extended</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Re-adjust straps and distribute weight evenly for best performance.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>How much weight can it hold?</summary>
            <p>
              This organizer is designed for light to moderate travel essentials, not heavy items. For best
              results, avoid overloading with dense or bulky items.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Troubleshooting</summary>

            <summary>How is this hat clip different from the magnetic version?</summary>
            <p>
              This version uses a snap-and-band system, not magnets. It secures around the back strap of your
              hat and clips to your bag using a heavy-duty clasp.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What hats are compatible?</summary>

            <p>It is designed specifically for hats that have a back strap or adjustable opening.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Where can I attach the clasp?</summary>
            <p>The zinc alloy clasp can attach to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Zipper pulls</li>

          <details>
            <summary>Will it hold securely in windy conditions?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes, when properly secured around the hat's back strap, it helps prevent losing your hat in
              moderate wind. In very strong wind conditions, additional caution is recommended.
            </p>
          </details>

              This product works best on hats with adjustable back straps. Hats without an opening or strap may
              not be compatible.

            <summary>How does the magnetic hat clip work?</summary>
            <p>
              The clip uses strong 2 x 2 cm magnets on both sides to hold the brim of your hat securely. The
              outer clasp attaches to your bag or purse strap, allowing hands-free carrying.

            <summary>What hats are compatible?</summary>
            <p>This clip is designed to work with many common hat styles, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Wide brim sun hats</li>

            <p>If a hat has an extremely thin, delicate, or decorative brim, test gently before use.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Will the magnet damage my hat?</summary>
            <p>The magnets are designed for fabric brims. However:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Avoid placing directly over delicate embellishments.</li>
              <li>Do not use on hats with fragile decorative stitching.</li>
              <li>Always remove carefully rather than pulling forcefully.</li>
            </ul>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What is the clip made of?</summary>
            <p>
              The exterior is made from premium faux leather, paired with a zinc alloy clasp, providing
              durability and a clean, polished appearance.

          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can I use this in windy conditions?</summary>
            <p>
              The clip provides strong magnetic hold for normal walking and travel conditions. In very high
              winds, we recommend holding your hat manually or placing it inside a bag for added security.
            </p>
          </details>

              accessories, bags, or valuables.

            <p>
